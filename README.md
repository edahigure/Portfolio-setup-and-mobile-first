# Project Name

> Portafolio-setup-and-mobile-first


## Built With

- HTML 5 
- CSS

## Getting Started
To run just open the index file with your browser application.
This project is a portafolio: the stage is setup and mobile first coding.
In this version we also have the desktop aplication for the portfolio project.
We use media query to give adaptavility. 
The idea is that a browser of small dimensions will apply the CSS code
because is a mobile application. For a browser of a larger size (larger than 1500px), it will
display the css code for the desktop version. 
This project will be the basis for a portfolio web page to promote my work.
