# Project Name

> Portafolio-setup-and-mobile-first


## Built With

- HTML 5 
- CSS

## Getting Started
To run just open the index file with your browser application.
This project is to be a base for a portafolio: the stage is setup and mobile first coding.
The idea is that a browser of small dimensions will apply the CSS code
because is a mobile application. For a browser of a larger size (larger than 1500px), it will
only display the HTML without CSS format. 
This project will be the basis for a portfolio web page to promote my work.
